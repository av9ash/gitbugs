# BugRepo

BugRepo maintains a collection of bug reports that are publicly available for research purposes. Bug reports are a main data source for facilitating NLP-based research in software engineering. We categorize the datasets into the following research directions.

### 2. Bug localization

Bug localization is a process to map a bug report to the corresponding buggy source file. This dataset contains bug reports, commit history, and API descriptions of six open source Java projects including Eclipse Platform UI, SWT, JDT, AspectJ, Birt, and Tomcat. The dataset is currently available [here](http://openscience.us/repo/issues/bugfiles.html).

### 3. Bug triaging

Given a software bug report, bug triaging is the process to identify an appropriate developer who could fix the bug. Automatic bug triaging algorithm can be formulated as a classification problem, which takes the bug title and description as the input, mapping it to one of the available developers (class labels). The dataset is currently available [here](http://bugtriage.mybluemix.net/).

### 4. Bug-fixing time estimation
The bug report datasets hosted in this repository contain detailed information about bug fixing time tracking, which can thus be used for research on bug-fixing time estimation.

### 5. Bug information mining
Lamkanfi et al. [MSR'13] contributed a dataset with over 200.000 reported bugs extracted from the Eclipse and Mozilla projects. Besides providing a single snapshot of a bug report, they also include all the incremental modifications as performed during the lifetime of the bug report. The dataset is currently available [here](https://github.com/ansymo/msr2013-bug_dataset).
