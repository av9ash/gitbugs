Port |Bug 752376 - Avoid calling scrollbox.ensureElementIsVisible() if the tab strip doesn't overflow to prevent layout flushes| to SeaMonkey,1606681,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2020-01-02 17:14:21+00:00,2020-11-01 20:04:54+00:00,"Port the following bug:
* Bug 752376 - Avoid calling scrollbox.ensureElementIsVisible() if the tab strip doesn't overflow to prevent layout flushes"
SeaMonkey (Mac) update version 2.49.5 made it impossible to edit old webpages!,1606979,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-01-04 02:32:49+00:00,2020-01-05 06:00:56+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_2) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/13.0.4 Safari/605.1.15

Steps to reproduce:

I was editing old webpages, just changing the wording in some text.. 


Actual results:

My page backgrounds disappeared and the placement of graphics was way off. I wasted 2 hours, doing everything carefully and testing my results step by step, but it was impossible to get things right. 

I had to go back to SeaMonkey version 2.49.4 in order to keep my page backgrounds and the placement of graphics. I wasted 2 hours today with version x.5 until I finally restored version x.4, and then everything went smoothly. 


Expected results:

I should have been able to edit the text and then upload the edited webpages to my website. But even pages that looked almost OK in SeaMonkey did not look OK in Safari and Chrome. Once I restored the older x.4 version, everything worked as it always has. I love SeaMonkey because of how simple it usually is!

(But I wish I could open composer and drag files into it instead of having to browse for them.)"

rss folder management buggy,1607173,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-01-06 12:04:04+00:00,2020-01-09 07:21:32+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I subscribed to RSS feeds and managed them in folders.


Actual results:

The folder management is very confusing. Sometimes one feed gets splitted into a folder and messages part which will not end up in the same folder.
Sometimes the feed is recieved in the main folder while displayed in the subfolder. You also will need a restart in order to get things displayed properly in the feed subscriptions.

I attached an example (where feed names where shortened due to privacy reasons). You see that the matrixorg feed appears twice in the subscription list alhough it was subscribed once. You also don't see it twice in the main window, but you might have odd results like recieving new messages in the wrong folder.

This might be related to a 15 year old bug, which I also experienced:

Expected results:

There sould just be one object that can be moved easily between the folders."

Install upgrade attempt result in endless reboot requirement and no functioning browser,1609590,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-01-16 03:06:08+00:00,2020-01-16 03:08:29+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0

Steps to reproduce:

Ran seamonkey-2.57a1pre.en-US.win64.installer.exe for build 20200114043003.
Forgot to close all running Seamonkey windows first.


Actual results:

The installer required a system reboot to complete the install.
I rebooted the computer.
On reboot, the Seamonkey icon had a different graphic and, on clicking on it, a messagebox popped up saying I needed to reboot to complete the installation.
The same messagebox popped up on my running the installer program, above, again.
Rebooted the system again.
Same situation.
Rebooted the system again.
Same situation.
Deleted all files and directories from C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Seamonkey, where the Seamonkey application is.
Ran the installer again.
The installer went farther this time and didn't request a reboot, but said, ""You don't have sufficient disk space to install to this location.""  (There is 245GB of free space.)
Looked in AppData\Local again;  the Seamonkey directory, which I hadn't deleted, was now gone.
Ran the installer again.
Seamonkey installed correctly and works fine.

If it is true that the installer required a reboot because the program was running, that's insane.
If it is true that the installer required a reboot because the program was running, why didn't it give the user a chance to fix the situation before requiring a reboot?
If it is true that the installer required a reboot because the program was running, why would it continue to require a reboot when the program wasn't running, no matter whether or not the reboot finished whatever was to be finished?

The disk space issue seems to be the same as:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1215786

I found other bugs, 12, 18, 20 year old, for the installer component that mention the word, ""reboot.""  A few are:

I have another program, I forget which, which won't run because it thinks my Windows version is too old; turns out it's because I have disabled some Windows Service, I forget which.
Perhaps the installer also thinks my Windows version is old.
I am running Windows 10, 1803.

Just about each and every action, like resize the window and inch, search some criteria, write inside text box like this one I'm writing now, go to the file menu, switch windows fromone seamonkeyt browser to another, type a new sentence, almost all of these and everytime something is done, there is a delay of 2 to 3 seconds whilst Seamonkley thinks about something, and gives me the rotating rainbow pie chart cursor.



Actual results:

This is making this new seamonkey unusable.

Is it checking the internet every 10 seconds ?

The attached movie shows, how the program keeps halting, however screen shoton the mac doesn't record the rainbow cursor for some reason. but you can clearly see when it pauses.


Expected results:

I have uploaded a screen shot movie here, link lasts 5 days or so.

We want to see normal fluid brousing and using without having to wait any time at all for anything.

So i'd thought i would type away at some of this to show you exactly what I mean.
Well there you go, a raindow cursor comes up just between these two sentences. I wonder if it will happen again, it usually only takes about 10 to 20 seconds. Well there you go. just to show you how annoying it is for the program to keep stopping all the time whilst it keeps catching up with itself. Hopeless, it makes seamonkey become unuseable."

download manager backend not initilaized if SeaMonkey is not started as normal browser (non private navigator) first,1612725,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2020-02-02 14:24:29+00:00,2020-11-01 20:15:06+00:00,"The sessionstore-windows-restored notification is not send if you start SeaMonkey with the private flag or with another component like mail/news. This means that the code in this._onBrowserStartup(subject) in nsSuiteGlue.js is not run initially. This wasn't much of a problem previously but now the jsdownloads backend is initialised here among other things. Currently this results in the download names not shown if you open it. Also the progress dialog is not shown. The taskbar is also not intialised. 

Workaround: As soon as you open a normal browser window the notification is send and the init code executed.

Not sure what the best solution is. Firefox sends the notification if only a private window is opened but our seession store is more or less different and outdated. Send it with a null window like in Fx also results in the notfication not shown (see Bug 573384) and if we have only a address book or mailnews window the startup code will like fail to show a notification too.

So probably best do move some components out of _onBrowserStartup and into a delayed startup like in Firefox after final-ui-startup is received.

I am not sure if we can fix it for 2.53.1 but if not the workaround should be put into the release notes."

Steps to reproduce:

Just had to browse the internet, on any given day, any given time.

I could have only one site open, or 4 tabs or more and it could end up all the same - getting so slow and waiting for clicks on links to happen or pages to scroll, etc.


Actual results:

It seems eventually Seamonkey starts to eat RAM. I'm not sure when or how, as it seems to happen randomly and no specific websites.

One minute things are going just fine, the next thing I know I'm waiting for the cursor to change when hovering on a link or waiting for the page to scroll, etc. The delays in things to happen usually are a couple seconds but no more than three seconds so far, but the delay in *every* thing I want to do, not just surfing, but doing anything on my computer, has that short delay anytime I want to do anything.

When I open ksysguard to see what might be the problem app, it's Seamonkey using 2+ GB of RAM (of my 12GB).

If I close Seamonkey and open/use Firefox (for instance) and go to the same sites I was just on, with the same number of tabs of the same sites, nothing is going wrong and ksysguard shows it only using around 190MB of RAM, so this was my non-scientific, simpleton test, heh.


Expected results:

Nothing other than just continue to not have the sudden delays for anything to happen on my computer when it suddenly starts to eat RAM.

Can't check out SeaMonkey 2.53.1 source,1618806,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2020-02-28 11:53:05+00:00,2020-03-12 12:31:58+00:00,"According to the README at <https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.1/README.txt> linked to from the SeaMonkey 2.53.1 release page at <https://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/2.53.1>, the instructions for pulling the code from the source repository begin as follows:

hg clone -r SeaMonkey_2_53_1_RELEASE https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-esr56

This is a non-starter, because no such repository exists:

$ hg clone -r SeaMonkey_2_53_1_RELEASE https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-esr56

I poked around <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/> but didn't see any *-esr56 repositories, nor do I see a SeaMonkey_2_53_1_RELEASE tag in any of the other repositories.

It would be great if this issue could be rectified as it's preventing us at openSUSE from efficiently packaging the new release."

Apple mail archives have disappeared today. (re: mac.com),1619019,RESOLVED,--,WORKSFORME,2020-02-28 23:46:31+00:00,2020-03-01 13:15:40+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 SeaMonkey/2.53.1 Lightning/5.8.1

Steps to reproduce:

I noticed that my apple mail archives no longer show up in Seamonkey as of this PM.  There were there this morning.


Actual results:

I went to archive an email to a folder in Seamonkey and all my archived folders were gone.  Gone on my and my wife's email set ups in Seamonkey.

I did a restore of my Seamonkey profile via Time Machine.  After restore, I could see the archives for a few seconds then they disappeared from Seamonkey again.

I then installed the new Seamonkey release out today, and it did not fix the problem.  I tried a Time Machine restore a second time, with the new version of Seamonkey and the same thing happened... a momentary view of the archives and they gone.

I then jumped on here and opened this ticket.


Expected results:

I should have been able to see the archives and been able to move emails into those archives (folders)."

with more option that  it will erase all of 9 checked items (from ""Browsing History"", to ""Authenticated Session"", see menu Preferences>Privacy & Security>Private Data). 

I browse some sites, say using profile1, and when I close it, a form called ""Clear Private Data"" is displayed that warn me before everything deleted; and I hit 'Clear Private Data Now' button.
Then I open a browser again with the same profile (profile1). A bug is, all of the link since last used, are still remembered.

This issue not happened in SeaMonkey version 2.49.5, but now happened in latest version.

There seem to be a few issues with the checksum files (MD5SUMS.txt, SHA1SUMS.txt, SHA512SUMS.txt) at <https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.1/>:

* The checksums for <source/seamonkey-2.53.1.source.tar.xz> are incorrect in all 3 files. Correct checksums are included in <source/seamonkey-2.53.1.checksums> (in the source/ subdirectory).
* Paths for language-specific builds are messed up, e.g. <platform/win32/en-US/cs/de/en-GB/seamonkey-2.53.1.en-GB.win32.zip should be just platform/win32/en-GB/seamonkey-2.53.1.en-GB.win32.zip> (without the <en-US/cs/de/> part) - each subsequent language has all previous languages in its path, even though they're not actually organised that way on the server.

Not so problematic, but presumably the paths should match organisation on the server:
* Paths for executable builds have <platform/> prefixed (e.g. <platform/win32/...> should presumably be just <win32/...>)
* Paths for updates have <tmp/releases/2.53.1/> (e.g. <tmp/releases/2.53.1/update/win32/...> should presumably be just <update/win32/...>)


Actual results:

* Checksums for the file downloaded from <https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.1/source/seamonkey-2.53.1.source.tar.xz> don't match those specified in MD5SUMS.txt, SHA1SUMS.txt and SHA512SUMS.txt
* File paths in MD5SUMS.txt, SHA1SUMS.txt, SHA512SUMS.txt do not match the paths to the files on the server


Expected results:

* Checksums for the file downloaded from <https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.1/source/seamonkey-2.53.1.source.tar.xz> should match those specified in MD5SUMS.txt, SHA1SUMS.txt and SHA512SUMS.txt

Actual results:

Waived the installer in Cylance
Windows won't elevate an unsigned executable, so still fails
Elevation block is not Windows default behavior, but likely to be enforced by group policy in an enterprise environment. Lack of digital signature may contribute to Cylance quarantining the installer.  I was able to work around both blocks at work; no problems at home where the system is less locked down.

Expected results:

The download window should reach the ""finished"" state once the download is complete.

Probably something is changed since 2.49.5 time, and now things work properly.

I was trying to copy/paste the previous days menu format and it SeaMonkey would not do it correctly, it had underlines and issues when I pasted it in, and trying to change text attributes made that random text disappear.......in SeaMonkey anyway.

I have several email accounts on SeaMonkey Mail client.
From command line (linux) I want to open a new composer window with ""From"" field being one specific email (ex.: myemail5@example.com) of my accounts. I run the command:

seamonkey -compose ""from='myemail5@example.com',to='to email <toemail@example.com>',subject='the subject',body='the body'""


Actual results:

Any other tries I did (using only from as option/ using the email/ using the email with my name)   , from is ignored. This was also happening in SeaMonkey 2.48 / 2.49


Expected results:

It should have use the ""from"" email, as command "" seamonkey --help "" suggests. 

Just now, as I was going to submit the bug, I discovered this bug:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630804#c2

which mentions the option ""preselectid=""  which isn't shown in the --help output. I tried all numbers from 1 to 10 without success. I wrote "" about:config "" in the address bar, and searched for my email. I got several lines, but from line with ""Preference Name"" mail.identity.id5.useremail, I got ""id5""  and I did my command as: 

seamonkey -compose ""preselectid=id5,to='to email <toemail@example.com>',subject='the subject',body='the body'""

From is still ignored, but this trick did the job.

Two suggestions: 
1) update of --help message to show ""preselectid"" option.
2) support of from, as I saw that works for thunderbird."

Hello Seamonkey Developers,

I have used Seamonkey since the first Netscape Navagator came out. It has served me well until now. I was having some difficulty with Seamonkey
V. 2.49.5 and went to your website. i downloaded V. 2.53.1. The software returns the message, ""Failed to Connect"". A copy of the message is attached. Yesterday I phoned my internet provider and the man took great pains and time to ensure that their system was properly coded on my Seamonkey program.

I do have an internet connection and Safari and Firefox both run without difficulty. My O.S. is a Mac running V. 10.13.6, Processor 2.7 GHz Intel core i5. I would appreciate your guidance in bringing Seamonkey broswer to operational condition.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

SeaMonkey consumes 100% CPU,1633339,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2020-04-27 08:23:45+00:00,2021-06-03 15:40:35+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.1 Lightning/5.8.1

Steps to reproduce:

Every once in a while, the browser starts consuming 100% CPU
(100% of one core, to be exact, see the screenshot - 25% of my 4 core CPU).
This started happening after upgrading to 2.53.1, it never happened
in the previous version (2.49.5). All versions are 32-bit running
on 32-bit Windows 7.

The steps to reproduce this are vague, I know, but there seems
to be a pattern. As far as I can tell, it is related to memory
and the garbage collector going on some sort of an infinite loop.
When this happens, the browser is essentially not usable, but
is working although with VERY VERY slow response to scrolling,
closing/switching tabs etc.

The pattern I observed:

* The ""age"" of the browser matters.

This seems to be related to how long the browser has been running.
I have never seen it in a freshly open browser. Instead, it usually happens
at the end of the day when I have been using it for the entire day.

* The number of tabs does not seem to matter

I have seen this happen with just a few tabs. At the time I captured
the attached logs, I had only 2 tabs open. However, the number of tabs
does seem to make it easier for this bug to happen. The most common
pattern - open a web site (I usually do this with a news website,
http://www.lenta.ru), then Ctrl+Shift+Click on multiple new articles
so that they are open in background tabs without switching to them.
Having said that, even opening 20-40 tabs does not trigger this reliably.
The critical part, I think, is how many tabs are being open at the same time,
not how many tabs are actually open in a ""complete"" state.

* The actual URL does not matter

Most commonly I see this on http://www.lenta.ru, but I suspect this
is just because of my browsing pattern. I have seen this happen
with other sites too. What is interesting is that even when the browser
gets into this ""loop"" state, if I kill the browser in the Task Manager
and restart it, when the browser restarts and opens all the same tabs
again, everything is working.

Bottom line - this seems to be a race condition of sorts somewhere
in the memory allocation or garbage collection. It is not a concrete
error on any one concrete page.

* Closing all tabs stops the loop

If I am patient enough and close all tabs, the browser becomes
responsive again. The attached logs were captured after closing
all tabs after getting into this ""loop"" state without restarting
the browser.

Unfortunately, this is as much information as I can gather.
This happens almost every day to me, but I do not have a very reliable
way to reproduce this. I am attaching concise and verbose memory
logs here. Please let me know if there is anything else I can capture,
preferably from the outside of the browser as getting it done
inside takes forever."

customization of toolbars in Composer and formatting toolbar in MailNews Composition allows moving buttons around,1639342,NEW,--,,2020-05-19 20:47:44+00:00,2020-05-19 20:50:26+00:00,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #606683 +++

In Bug 606683 both Composer toolbars were made customizable. It is now possible to move a button from the formatting toolbar into the general toolbar and vice versa. Depending on the status of the main window the new buttons are either not hidden or are hidden together with the toolbar.
Auto Enable/Disable of the items seems to work. 
Possible fix might be to not autohide/show the formatting toolbar."

Since there was already a mail contact like karl.huber@mail.invalid in some prior conversation, Seamonkey always suggested this one and even replaced ""huber@mail.invalid"" with ""karl.hber@mail.invalid"" when pressing the enter key. This even happened when deleting the auto suggestion (by pressing del) and pressing enter afterwards.
I had to type <huber@mail.invalid> to manage to send to that one.

Not that in a big company there are often people with the same surnames or similar names. So this behaviour is quite unhandy and can lead to mailing wrong people by mistake.


Expected results:

Thunderbird 68.9 will keep ""huber@mail.invalid"" if you delete the auto suggestions, which can be a way to handle this.
However, Seamonkey should not ignore if you don't want to use the contact of the auto suggestion."
"Won't play videos at many popular websites, Opera can play them?",1644824,RESOLVED,--,WORKSFORME,2020-06-10 18:02:56+00:00,2020-06-16 12:01:21+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.2

Steps to reproduce:

Clicked to play a video in SeaMonkey. Many site videos fail to open or play on many popular sites. Just get a blank box. Opera can play with no problems. Also scrolling/lockup issues. Try scrolling on sites like Amazon browsing history or Home Depot. Very slow or freezes the 64-Bit browser under Windows 10 64-Bit. See example, sorry bad lanquage: https://therightscoop.com/watch-man-threatens-to-up-a-bunch-of-nypd-officers-it-doesnt-go-well-for-him/


Actual results:

Will not play video links on many websites. You get a blank box. See example link above. Many Vimeo videos fail to play. YouTube videos play okay.

Browsing my Amazon browsing history of items previously viewed, causes SeaMonkey v2.53.2 to freeze, crash, or stall. Home Depot is similarly very slow to scroll up or down.


Expected results:

I am not seeing these issues in Opera or MS Edge. Don't use Chrome, due to privacy tracking issues. Is there an Add-On or Extension that SeaMonkey needs installed to play common website videos?"

Exporting SeaMonkey v2.53.3's addressbook does not contain all datas.,1654719,NEW,--,,2020-07-23 03:03:08+00:00,2021-03-10 22:06:14+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.3

Steps to reproduce:

1. Make a SeaMonkey (SM) v2.53.3's address book's contact with most/all datas filled out like addresses (home especially), phone numbers, etc.
2. Export this address book into a VCF file from its Tools menu.
3. View this VCF file in a text editor or import into a program that can VCFs.


Actual results:

Inside the exported VCF, it is missing datas as shown in SM's address book. For an example with my test:
begin:vcard
fn:ant dude
n:dude;ant
org:;a dept
adr:;;1234 address;some city;ca;12345;usa
email;internet:ant@farm.edu
title:worker
note:some notes
url:http://work.edu
version:2.1
end:vcard

I have a home address. Why was it not exported correctly?


Expected results:

SeaMonkey's address book's export should exported all datas.

Thunderbird v78.0.1's address book's export to VCF files had no problems when it migrated my abook.mab into abook.sqlite file when I tested it. It seems like SeaMonkey has an export VCF bug. I was able to reproduce this in updated mac OS Mojave v10.14.6 and Debian Jessie v8 machines too."

Poor rendering of pages on GitHub,1655478,RESOLVED,--,INCOMPLETE,2020-07-27 15:02:57+00:00,2021-10-07 11:39:32+00:00,"SeaMonkey 2.53.3 has problems rendering certain pages and page elements on GitHub.  The problems did not occur when I was using SeaMonkey 2.53.2 (though I suppose it is possible that GitHub updated its UI at about the same time that 2.53.3 was released).

Examples of rendering problems:

1. Most of the issue search results page are completely scrambled.  See <https://github.com/logological/gpp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+master> as an example.  The attached screenshots show the problematic rendering in SeaMonkey 2.53.2 and correct rendering in Firefox 78.0.2.

2. On any GitHub form that allows you to enter Markdown and to preview it in a separate tab, the preview tab always shows an ""Error rendering preview"" message.  See <https://github.com/logological/gpp/issues/new> for an example (but note that this page can be viewed only if you are logged into a GitHub account).

Expose intl.locale.matchOS in the UI in SeaMonkey,1655842,NEW,--,,2020-07-28 20:23:37+00:00,2022-12-15 12:06:15+00:00,"The ""intl.locale.matchOS"" preference still does not mentioned anywhere in UI, but is widely used at downstream level.
It can confuse downstream users, since the existing UI still offers the manual choice, whereas this choice has no effect (if the preference is set).

Due to technical policies, Linux and UNIX distros should provide all the langpacks in their packages. The choice of language is determined at runtime by environment variables (LC_MESSAGES, or LC_ALL, or LANG). Thus ""intl.locale.matchOS"" is normally set there.

Certainly some langpacks can be separated into additional subpackages to preserve disk space, but ""by design"" it remains the same -- the choice by env vars.

(To decrease possible startup performance issues, langpacks might be repackaged from "".xpi"" file to plain dir, with chrome.manifest uncompressed and other stuff recompressed into a new .jar file)."

Browser: Frequent short UI freezes on particular web pages,1658118,RESOLVED,--,WORKSFORME,2020-08-08 10:36:26+00:00,2022-01-04 02:34:29+00:00,"I'm experiencing frequent UI freezes with Seamonkey (if memory serves me right since ~ version 2.49), e.g. when loading a new website, entering an URL in the URL bar, while scrolling on a website or even multiple times while typing this text.

In all of those cases CPU usage increases to 100% on one CPU, stays that way for maybe 2 seconds, and the complete UI is frozen during that time (though events will be processed once it normalizes again). My impression is that this always happens when an opened website is using a lot of JavaScript.

Steps to reproduce:
===================

A good example is when visiting Kickstarter (even when doing so with a fresh profile):
* Visit https://www.kickstarter.com
* The Seamonkey logo in the upper right corner will freeze for about a second, together with the rest of the UI
* As soon as the site is loaded, click on one of the categories (e.g. ""Games"").
* This time, Seamonkey will freeze even longer

Older Seamonkey versions or the current Firefox version keep reacting during the whole time. My impression is that Seamonkey will be permanently slower even when closing the tab after that.

I'm not sure whether this is platform specific - it is happening for me both on my openSUSE and Slackware Linux PCs, but I don't have a Windows or Mac PC for comparison."

There are at least two ways to reproduce this: in Mail&News by saving two or more attachments at once and in the Navigator Page Info dialog Media tab, also by saving two or more items at the same time.

This may have been introduced by bug 1335539, where the use of wrapDOMFile in nsFilePicker.js was replaced with createFromNsIFile[1]. This seems to fail silently when the file picker is used to choose a directory. Adding a catch() to these promises, I get NS_ERROR_FILE_IS_DIRECTORY.

If I'm understanding the code correctly, CreateFromNsIFile in dom/file/File.cpp calls FileCreatorHelper::CreateFile in FileCreatorHelper.cpp, which calls CreateFileInternal, which calls CreateBlobImpl. This last one calls InitializeChromeFile in MultipartBlobImpl.cpp, which will fail for directories (line 360 for 2.53.3 final).

Steps to reproduce:

- I'm opening a new tab from some link in some panel, the tab is the last one (browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent = false, I like this setting)
- I close this (newest) tab


Actual results:

- the browser switches to the tab left to the just closed (to the tab the far right), browser doesn't return back to the tab from which I opened the link


Expected results:

I would like the browser to return to the tab from which I opened the link as in 2.49.5.

Explanation:

I just updated SeaMonkey from 2.49.5 to 2.53.3. And I see different behavior.

2.49.5:
- I'm opening a new tab from some link
- I close this (newest) tab and the browser returns to the original tab from which I opened the link

2.53.3:
- I'm opening a new tab from some link
- I close this tab and the browser switches to the tab on the far right, browser doesn't return back to the tab from which I opened the link

I search in about:config, ""browser.tabs"" but there is no option to toggle."

Can't use the video controls on some websites,1666681,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-09-23 04:11:18+00:00,2021-03-10 22:05:35+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.3

Steps to reproduce:

Only about 15-20% of the websites with videos that I visit, the video controls will not work when I click on them.  You can start the video but, after it starts I can't fast forward using the sliding bar at the bottom to another part of the video.  When I click on the ""stop"" button, it won't stop.  When I click on the ""full screen"" icon it will not go to full screen.  I tried to figure out what video player the sites are using and have been unable to figure out it.  I believe it started in the version before 2.53.  I hoped it would be fixed before version 2.53 came out.  However, the controls still are not working on videos on certain sites.  It seems that some sites changed overnight.  The videos work correctly and the next day the controls don't work.  The videos controls work correctly on Firefox, Chrome and MS Edge but not on Seamonkey.


Actual results:

Searched the web for answers and found none.  None of the video controls worked on a few site with videos.  Tried the same sites with the videos on Firefox, Chrome and MS Edge and they all worked fine.


Expected results:

The video controls should work on all sites as Firefox, Chrome and MS Edge does."

MailNews:Composition & Composer: changing text/bg-color often malfunctions & freezes the document-window,1673203,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-10-24 23:03:37+00:00,2021-03-10 22:04:23+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.4

Steps to reproduce:

This bug happens frequently when I try to change the text-color of an already typed text, or background color, both in the HTML- Composer-page or writing or editing a new e-mail.


Actual results:

Instead of the normal color-menu, with the various little colors to choose from, I get a blank grey block of the same size, and the window freezes: I can no longer work on this document, not close it either. All other open windows do work, but I have to entirely shut down SeaMonkey, and therefore most often loose what new document I was working on. 


Expected results:

The menu for colors (text- or background) should have opened normally, like it did in the earlier versions. (2.49) and I should have been able to keep on working."

Constant intermitant hang ups while typing or scrolling.,1679326,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-11-25 22:23:44+00:00,2021-03-10 22:06:57+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.5.1

Steps to reproduce:

I didn't have to do a thing.  The system is constantly hanging up while typing and scrolling.  The pointer stops moving, the the Windows busy icon comes up, and then after a few seconds it releases and you can start scrolling again.  When typing the flashing vertical line just freezes up and you can't see what you are typing until after it releases.  So far it has hung up three times just while I  have been typing this!


Actual results:

See above.


Expected results:

I should be able to type and scroll with NO interuptions, like I eas able to do up until a few months ago.  I have two desktops and one laptop.  One of the desktops is running Windows 7, the laptop and the other desktop are on Windows 10 and all three have the exact same problem!  The laptop and Windows 7 desktop both have had a clean install of Windows in the past four months.  Also the Microsoft Edge web browser DOES NOT have this problem so it is NOT a Windows problem, but a Seamonkey problem.  I can't believe that I am the only person having this problem."

Steps to reproduce:

[Environment:]
Windows 10 Pro
SeaMonkey 2.53.5.1 - 20201115161931

As a way of ensuring that I don't forget my account passwords, I do not let the password manager save my password for POP and IMAP connections, so that I have to enter passwords on first connection to servers.  The expectation is for entering passwords once per session. (I do allow saving for SMTP and LDAP connections, so that I don't have to enter each time I touch the server for those functions.)






Actual results:

Since upgrade to 2.53.4, Seamonkey seems to be forgetting session passwords.  Over the course of a workday, clicking on ""Get Msgs"" for an account without a password saved in the password manager causes a prompt for a password.  This is happening with multiple accounts on different services (and different mail server software).  


Expected results:

Keep entered passwords for POP and IMAP connections cached until the end of the session.  

I am not seeing similar behavior in any versions of Thunderbird."

This prob also occurs in title properties of tags and prob just about everywhere that a space can be inserted. 


Actual results:

Steps to reproduce:

Compiled Seamonkey on FreeBSD 11.3 for 11.3 due to not being able to compile it on 12.2. Started the Binaries on a 12.2 with the FreeBSD 11.x compatibility package installed.

Actual results:

Crashes about 5-7 seconds after startup - unless the password manager master password dialog is open for at least 7 seconds.
Another way to not have it crash is when you start it with the profile manager and create a new profile. However, it only helps once. After closing seamonkey and restarting it with this new profile, it crashes.

Provide complete and correct instructions for fetching and building source,1684460,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2020-12-29 15:34:16+00:00,2022-07-08 00:32:21+00:00,"I package SeaMonkey for openSUSE but as of 2.53.6b1 my usual checkout + build process is no longer working due to the removal of `client.mk` from the base directory.  I'm trying to figure out the current correct way of fetching the source from version control and building it, but the documentation for this seems to be scattered, contradictory, incorrect, and incomplete.  It would be helpful if a complete and correct version of the instructions could be put in *one* place.  I'll try to provide an overview of the interrelated problems with the documentation, but please excuse me if this gets a bit hairy.

Let's start at the [README](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.6b1/README.txt), because this directly linked from [the release page](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/2.53.6b1) with the description ""The README file explains how to pull SeaMonkey 2.53.6 Beta 1 from the source repository.""

The very beginning of the README gives the following instructions for checking out the sources from version control:

> These binaries were all built from SeaMonkey's 2.53 GitLab repositories, off
> the 2_53_6_beta_01 branch, and Mozilla's repositories for the extensions, off the
> default branch, with the following commands used to obtain the sources:
> 
>    git clone -b 2_53_6_beta_01 https://gitlab.com/seamonkey-project/seamonkey-2.53-comm.git comm-253
>    cd comm-253
>    git clone -b 2_53_6_beta_01 https://gitlab.com/seamonkey-project/seamonkey-2.53-mozilla.git mozilla
>    cd mozilla/extensions
>    hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/chatzilla irc
>    hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/dom-inspector inspector

These commands work fine, insofar as they don't result in any errors.  However, the README goes on to say that

> A source code tarball with the contents of all the repositories, ready to
> build, is available for download from the source/ subdirectory here on FTP.

There are a couple problems with this statement:

1. It refers to getting files by FTP, but all the download links on the release page are to an HTTP server.  Maybe an official FTP server still exists somewhere, but if so, it doesn't seem to be the preferred way of downloading the tarball any more, and in any case these instructions don't help users who are looking for the tarball on the web server instead.  Rather than writing ""here on FTP"", it would be better to provide the exact URL(s) of the source/ subdirectory.  In the case of 2.53.6b1, this is presumably <https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.6b1/source/> for the tarball hosted on the web server.

2. The tarball hosted on the web server has a different directory structure than the one produced with the instructions at the beginning of the README.  As far as I can tell, it was produced by first checking out the seamonkey-2.53-mozilla repository and then checking out the seamonkey-2.53-comm repository in a subdirectory, rather than the other way around.  If this is the correct way of doing things now, then the instructions in the README need to be updated.  If it's not the correct way of doing things, then the source tarball needs to be restructured.  If both ways are correct, then the README needs to mention this (and to explain why it chose to provide instructions that result in a source tree that differs so conspicuously from the official source tarball).

The README goes on with the following instructions for building SeaMonkey:

> Read https://www.seamonkey-project.org/dev/ for instructions on how to build
> your own copy of SeaMonkey.

This statement is problematic because that page contains no instructions at all for building SeaMonkey. The closest hint it provides is to to check the Mozilla developer guide:

> Even though we are independent from [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/), as we're based on the same framework as Firefox, most of the [mozilla.org developer pages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide) also apply to SeaMonkey, there's also content there that explains [how to get the comm-central source code](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Getting_comm-central), which includes the current SeaMonkey development code.

Unfortunately, the link titled ""how to get the comm-central source code"" goes to a nonexistent page.  The previous link, ""mozilla.org developer pages"", is a bit more useful as it leads to a page with a [Build Instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions) link described as ""How to build Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, or other Mozilla applications.""  That page in turn links to a [Simple Seamonkey build](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_SeaMonkey_build) page that purports to contain instructions for checking out the source, creating a basic `.mozconfig` file, and building the application.  But there are two problems with these instructions:

1. The instructions for checking out the source are completely different from those contained in the SeaMonkey README.  Following these instructions results in yet another source tree, different from both the one you get from following the README instructions and the one from the official source tarball.  Perhaps this is because the instructions on MDN are for checking out the master branch rather than the branch/tag for a particular version of SeaMonkey, but even if so, this doesn't help people who came to these instructions from the README.

2. The instructions don't actually work; they say to run `python client.py checkout` but the repository doesn't contain any `client.py` file in the base directory.  (See [mdn/content Issue 725](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/725).)

In summary, it would be helpful if the following could be fixed:

1. The instructions for checking out the source code given in the README should result in a source tree that bears at least a passing resemblance to the one you get from the official source tarball.

2. The instructions in the README should be more specific about where to obtain the source tarballs (code, l10n, language packs) rather than just saying ""here on FTP"".

3. The instructions in the README and at https://www.seamonkey-project.org/dev/ should refer to a page that contains complete and correct build instructions.

4. If said build instructions are supposed to live at the [Simple Seamonkey build](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_SeaMonkey_build) on MDN, then those instructions should be modified so that (a) the source checkout instructions are correct, and (b) the build instructions are comprehensible and correct for someone who checked out the source for a particular version of SeaMonkey using the the very different method specified in the SeaMonkey README."

The test statement can however be run from the Scratchpad.

Obviously this isn't satisfactory.

I don't know whether it affects other code branches with Scratchpad (eg, incomplete implementation of bug 1317375), or it's specific to SeaMonkey, or it's just an issue from porting to SeaMonkey. It was probably present in 2.49.x. Apparently (bug 1565380) Scratchpad is no longer shipped in FireFox, and and I don't have a relevant old version to hand for testing."

Steps to reproduce:

On the release notes for SeaMonkey 2.53.6 at <https://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.53.6/>, under ""Known Issues"", there is a link to bug 1684651 (text ""The scrollbar is not always visible on some websites under recent macOS versions (10.15 upwards) see bug 1684651."")

The href attribute on the ""bug 1684651"" anchor is missing the opening quote, leading to the closing quote being interpreted as part of the URL and giving a broken link to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1684651%22>. Fairly minor and easy enough to work around by removing ""%22"" (displayed as a quote in the address bar) for those who realise what's happened, but I figured it'd probably be good to correct for future releases if that issue is likely to still need to be mentioned.

Actual results:

Expected results:

Transmit the re-entered password following the prompt (and not having to cancel the exchange).  I believe that without the cancel, the re-entered password is being ignored, and the original mis-entered password is being resent.  This is happening with both POP and IMAP connections.

This one seems not to be a universal problem.  I've not seen an issue when connecting to servers running Zimbra or Exchange, but I have seen it with Fastmail (which I've discovered runs Cyrus IMAP), and I believe I saw the same issue on another server that I used to use that was also Cyrus IMAP.

I'm inclined to suggest that this might be something that is specific to Cyrus IMAP."

Steps to reproduce:

I have been using SeaMonkey for 5+ years.  Last year or os its memory footprint on MacOS is massive.  

Keen to understand if this is web, email, or some other feature issue as it doesn't seem obvious what is hording memory.  I have two large IMAP email accounts which may be unique to my usage, otherwise web browsing is modest.


Actual results:

A broken choice of chatzilla's taskbar icon leads to a constant redrawing of the screen.

Disable ALL the extensions (chatzilla, inspector, lightning) in about:addons, and run SeaMonkey from cmdline with debug:

The debug output stopped after the page is completed, until you move mouse etc., then it stopped again etc.etc It is an expected behaviour.

Then enable chatzilla in about:addons and repeat the MOZ_LOG run.

After the page is completed, the debug output still present infinitely, despite you do nothing.

The problem is suite/extensions/irc/xul/skin/images/taskbar-irc.gif icon, with size 16x10 .
It seems the code require geometry of 16x16 in this area. If you try to use png or jpg icon with another size there, it just not appear. But in the case of gif, the icon with the size of 16x10 (instead of 16x16) still appear, with a side effect of permanent refreshing of the screen (according to the debug output)."

Linux: Handling of dead keys in text input fields broken since GTK 3.24.26,1701288,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2021-03-26 16:36:24+00:00,2021-04-15 00:32:25+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.8

Steps to reproduce:

GTK 3.24.26 was released a month ago and introduced a new way of handling dead keys. Usually, pressing ` does not show anything and only after pressing e one sees è. Starting with that GTK version, ` is already displayed, accompanied by a ""short _"" below the accent, and pressing e afterwards yields è.  A visualisation can be seen in this blogpost: https://blog.gtk.org/2021/03/24/input-revisited/




Actual results:

Trying to type è (or any other letters in combination with dead keys) in any text field in SeaMonkey (URL bar, new mail, this bug submission form, ...) yields è`. Namely, the accent is printed twice, once on the letter and once after it.


Expected results:

The input text should read è.

I observed this issue with both the latest version from WG9s (that uses bundled libraries) as well as with my self-build version on Arch Linux (that uses system libraries). A test downgrade to GTK 3.24.25 restored the functionality.

I also tested it with previous official versions: Dead keys work as expected up to version 2.53.4 but are broken starting with 2.53.5b1.

This issue does not occur with neither the current Firefox nor with the latest Waterfox Classic 56.5 (waterfox-classic-2021.02.en-US.linux-x86.tar.bz2)."

SeaMonkey 2.53.7 broke mouse wheel tab switching,1704151,RESOLVED,--,DUPLICATE,2021-04-09 17:40:08+00:00,2021-04-10 01:07:54+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

Steps to reproduce:

Up to SeaMonkey 2.53.6, I was using Tab Wheel Scroll extension: https://addons.thunderbird.net/pl/seamonkey/addon/tab-wheel-scroll/

This way, scrolling the mouse on the tab bar itself acted as previous/next tab switching control.


Actual results:

Upgraded to SeaMonkey 2.53.7. Scrolling doesn't work. After filling the tab bar with more tabs (so it overfills and gets scroll buttons), I've noticed scroll wheel now acts as scrolling of the bar itself.  The Tab Wheel Scroll extension doesn't work.

HOWEVER! There is a single pixel line just above the tab bar where mouse wheel scrolling actually works and switches the active tab. It's invisible, but it's there. Also, scrolling the wheel above the ""new tab"" or ""close tab"" buttons does what it's supposed to, even with the extension disabled.

The about:config setting ""browser.tabs.mouseScrollAdvancesTab"" (default: true) doesn't do what it's supposed to (and never did according to bug #1416737). HOWEVER, it does do something - when scrolling on the invisible line, it switches by TWO tabs instead of one when the setting is disabled (set to false).


Expected results:

Optimally, browser.tabs.mouseScrollAdvancesTab should behave like I expect (which it did since Netscape times, and apparently until SeaMonkey 2.40). Scrolling on the tabs themselves should switch active tab. Setting to off should bring the current behavior back.

I would leave the setting ON by default, arguing that Chrome does the same on Linux, although it can be off just like FireFox. For FireFox, this setting is also off by default, but can be enabled with the setting ""toolkit.tabbox.switchByScrolling"".

Alternatively, I would happily keep using the above mentioned extension, but something in SM 2.53.7 broke it."

> * Source Localisation Tarball (xz, 12 MB) - note that it doesn't unpack a subdirectory itself, so create a directory to unpack it in.

When finally two cells are left, these two cannot be united. For that purpose an extra row must be created, then the two previous cells can be united, whereupon the extra row can be deleted.


Expected results:

More easy and supple uniting of cells in a created table.."
cutting and pasting links and images by default a local link is offered.,1709845,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2021-05-06 12:44:25+00:00,2021-05-06 12:44:25+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.1.2 Safari/605.1.15

Steps to reproduce:

Cut and pasting links and images


Actual results:

All links are by default changed into local links, exept for http- links, so that for each copy/paste action for links and images the links must be adapted before uploading the page to one's site. Furthermore in later versions It is not possible anymore to set the link correct for both image source and for a relative link on that image, so that one must adapt the trouble in source mode. Also it is compulsory to check for alternative text in image link editor. 


Expected results:

1) The default for copying links and images should be a relative link, not a local one, 2) both link and picture source one must be able to correct, and 3) checking the checkbox for an alternative text for a picture should not be compulsory. The first two issues were functional in previous versions, but have been lost in later updates. The latter issue always has been so."

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to build using a script which worked on the same version when I used patched rustc-1.51.0 earlier this week. Standard 'blfs' instructions as at https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/xsoft/seamonkey.html

Note: we prefer gcc and g++, but that is irrelevant to this rust problem.


Actual results:

First build:
   Compiling log v0.4.1
error: Cannot set `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` from build script of `encoding_rs v0.8.16`.
note: Crates cannot set `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP` themselves, as doing so would subvert the stability guarantees of Rust for your project.
help: If you're sure you want to do this in your project, set the environment variable `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=encoding_rs` before running cargo instead.

Second build with 'export RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=encoding_rs' got further, but similar failure re packed_simd v0.3.4.

Success with 'export RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=encoding_rs,packed_simd'



Expected results:

I hoped the build would not need any changes, but I'm not surprised.

For the moment I'm content to use those exports, but I guess the code ought to be changed in some way and I'm afraid I have no idea how.

Hope the 'Production' choice for 'Version' is correct."

dropping of addresses from Address Book into a compose window address field is handled twice,1712002,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2021-05-19 22:50:04+00:00,2021-06-03 19:41:02+00:00,"As frg observed, dragging and dropping contacts from the address book into a compose window address field does not produce the expected result - if contacts abc, def and xyz are selected, and dropped in the first empty address field, the result will be something like:

To: def
To: xyz


This is present in 2.53.9b1pre and also in 2.49.5. This appears to be caused by the drop event being handled twice. The field where the selection is dropped gets the corresponding address (in this case abc), and the whole selection as a comma-separated list. If ""abc"" is long enough, and depending on the drop location inside the field, the comma-separated list may appear in the middle of ""abc"". Using ""undo"" in the affected field then shows ""abc"".

He was able to identify that nss was involved, and fixed this by downgrading nss to 3.64. Doing that also fixed my build with gcc-11.1.0.

Not sure whether seamonkey or nss is the problem, but since only seamonkey seems to be affected I'll start here.

switch to VT and back disconnects IRC server,1713051,REOPENED,--,,2021-05-27 06:50:37+00:00,2023-03-19 14:47:54+00:00,"original summary:
switch to VT and back disconnects IRC server

To Reproduce:
1 open Chatzilla in SeaMonkey (e.g. v2.53.7.1)
2 open an IRC server, e.g. freenode
3 open a channel, e.g. #seamonkey
4 switch to any of vtty 3-6
5 wait indeterminate time (usually a minute or more)
6 switch back to Xorg

Actual Behavior:
1 IRC server disconnected with ""Connection to irc://freenode/ ... timed out"" at the instant of return to X

Expected Behavior:
1 IRC server connection is and has been maintained while VT has sole focus

Notes:
1 this is old, estimated at least 3 years, possibly even 5+, before which connection was never broken on account of switch to VT and back
2 this is not reproduced at will on all installations, if at all. e.g. On this openSUSE 15.2 PC running KDE3, which is an upgrade of an upgrade ad infinitum where I first noticed the breakage, I only noticed recently difficulty in reproducing, while on another PC running Plasma on Xorg on Fedora 34, it reproduced on first attempt.
3 SM startup exporting MOZ_LOG=""nsIOService:5 nsSocketTransport:5 TCPSocket:5"" & MOZ_LOG_FILE= on the same Fedora 34 took several attempts over a long time to reproduce.
4 I subsequently tried again to reproduce on this openSUSE 15.2, which succeeded.
5 I have often noticed on return to VT a fresh email pull in progress if the return is to the virtual desktop on which SeaMonkey Mail, running in a separate SM instance, is open
6 MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1 is always set here via .bashrc here due to use of two SM instances (profiles) running most of the time

It at least asks if the user wants it to remember the password, but the answer by default is ""Yes"".


Expected results:

Since ""Remember Passwords"" is (globally) disabled, ChatZilla should not remember any password. It shouldn't even ask, as the user's preference is clearly ""Don't remember passwords.""

On the next day the video-pages the YouTube start-page worked again, but my YouTube-Subscription and channel pages remains blank. This happens with the 2.53 branch as well as with the 2.57 branch.

When I switch the user agent to modern Firefox all pages go blank again (like on the first day when it happened)

It goes to the video and you can see it's downloading the video from the server or something and then it says ""Done"" and doesn't play.

I looked at he web developer tab and it says there are errors with the video size format and there are other video errors.


Expected results:

Normally the video starts after a second of the wavy logo on screen.  This was working no problem up until a few days ago when I upgraded to 2.53.10. I then reverted to 2.53.9.1 but the problem was still there. I am using the default Seamonkey user agent but I tried a Firefox user string ESR 60 and FF 57.0. No luck.

Steps to reproduce:

I see this performance degradation  issue daily over time.  When I restart Seamonkey  after the performance issue it takes Seamonkey anywhere from 4 to 5 minutes to actually exit cleanly.  When running Seamonkey the performance degrades over time.


Actual results:

Ever since I upgraded to Seamonkey 2.53.7.1 from the older release Seamonkey's performance has degraded.  I constantly see things like these:
----
ATTENTION: default value of option force_s3tc_enable overridden by environment.

** (seamonkey:25048): WARNING **: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.freedesktop.Avahi was not provided by any .service files

WebGL(0x7f5007bd4800)::ForceLoseContext
----
and when monitoring performance with top I see Seamonkey running thread after thread even when on simple web pages.  I am also seeing a thread using 99.9% of the CPU processing when things get really degraded.  The other applications are not being effected - i.e. xterms, and other gui programs.  I basically have the email window open and two windows for web browsing using tabs.  Also note,  I am using Seamonkey 2.53.7.1 in the same fashion and setup that I have been using for over 20 years.   And I have folders and emails from the same period of time.

I upgraded to Slackware 14.2 from Slackware 14.0 and am using the same laptop and environment setup.  I have 24 GB of emails and data in the .mozilla/.cache directories and hundreds of folders and subfolders.  I also regularly compress folders when removing emails I do not need to keep.

I did try and build they very latest version but it requires a new compiler and will not build on Slackware 14.2.  And since one can not go back to the pre-2.53 release due to the incompatible updates I am stuck on 2.53.7.1 right now.  The latest version requires one to be Slackware 15.0

User Agent String: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 SeaMonkey/2.53.7.1

Based upon system backups I believe I was running 2.49.5 or 2.53.4 before I did this update.  I am also using the same Window Manager - fvwm2.


Expected results:

The basic performance should not have degraded the way it has simply by upgrading to the new version.  And why threads are doing what they are doing does not make sense."

so it also displays an error message.

Firefox has about 10 processes open (again, clean start), with the largest
taking about 160M of RAM. The memory does not go up and just stays

Performance issues with 2.53.12 are worse than 2.53.7.1,1771529,RESOLVED,--,DUPLICATE,2022-05-27 18:12:17+00:00,2022-05-28 21:19:33+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

I simply running Seamonkey with the mail window and 2 web windows open.  Seamonkey is using over 1 Gb of memory regularly and is regularly using 99+% of the processor when in a basic idle mode.  In one case I noticed with top Seamonkey was actively using over 2GB of memory.  It is also opening numerous threads even when Seamonkey is basically in an idle mode and static simple pages are displayed.

Or to summarize simply using Seamonkey to get email and have web pages displayed.


Actual results:

Seamonkey is not responding to keyboard and mouse command often and is using excessive amounts of system resources where the system stop responding normally.  These problems all started occurring when I started using the 2.53.7.1 release.  The performance issues have gotten worse with 2.53.12, which I downloaded from the Mozilla web site.  

I am also running into issues with Facebook and other sites which used to work fine.  Got a script error pop-up on the one site.  On Facebook I can not enter text but links will be followed.  I am using Seamonkey in the same way I have been for 20 or so years.  If I use Firefox, 68.12.0esr, to access the web sites I can do the stuff without a problem.  Even as I enter the bug issue Seamonkey is consuming 1.9GB of the 4GB of memory on the systems.  

I am running on the same system as I was using before when I flagged the performance issue with 2.53.7.1  The system is a 64 bit system with 4GB of memory and the .mozilla directory is currently at 23GB of space usage due to emails (20 years or more of data).  I often see, via top, 12 or more threads running using 50% or more of the processors.  And when I do a ""quit"" for seamonkey it often takes 5 minutes to shutdown.  Opening the email filter window and save data windows often take around 5 minutes before the windows are usable.

These performance issues should not be occurring and did not start occurring until the internal changes related to using the Firefox and Thunderbird engines started being done.


Expected results:

Seamonkey should be performing smoothly as it did prior to the 2.53 alterations.

I also flagged this performance issue a while back and it was closed since I was not using the current release."

    3. right-click close to the top of a video picture. Selection box around the picture doesn't appear, selecting ""Copy link location"" from context menu does NOT change clipboard contents - this is the main issue. Selecting ""Open link in a new tab"" works on both occasions, so I am definitely clicking on a hyperlink and so it should be copied on both occasions too.

This is not 100% reproducible: sometimes, usually the first time, clicking on the top works just like clicking on the bottom, if it happens, try again with another video."

"Address Book: ""Get Map"" button is not shown for home addresses",1779319,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2022-07-12 22:15:45+00:00,2022-10-16 21:51:36+00:00,"When displaying contacts/cards, the Address Book can show ""Get Map"" buttons for street addresses which are set, but currently (I've been testing with 2.53.12 and a 2.53.13b1pre build) it will only show this button for the work address.

This appears to be caused by the changes in bug 1428100. For both Home/Private and Work contact sections, there is a variable that signals whether there is content to display so far. In both SeaMonkey and Thunderbird, this variable is named ""visible"" for the Home/Private section and ""addressVisible"" for the Work section, but the suite/ part of the patch uses ""addressVisible"" for both sections."
SeaMonkey 2.53.13 crashes often (regression from 2.53.12),1780322,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2022-07-20 02:39:07+00:00,2022-08-01 11:35:15+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.12

Steps to reproduce:

It seems that the 2.53.13 release is much worse that the previous 2.53.12 release.
The new release seems to be noticeably slower on many pages. Furthermore,
the browser crashes more often even from a clean start and a single page open.

The 3 sites, where I see this happening very consistently are these (there could be others):

* Yahoo Finance stock charts, for example (https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/PYPL)
* Google Spreadsheets
* E-Trade (requires a login)

Sorry, I do not have a public file for Google Spreadsheets. Most likely,
any table will cause problems. The one I use is a very trivial table,
no fancy charts or scripts. Just a small table with a few columns
and about 100 rows.


Actual results:

The browser is noticeably slower, often crashes. Sometimes the browser
shows clear signs of the screen corruption (and crashes soon).


Expected results:

The pages should open and work as expected (and were in 2.53.12)."

Expanding XHR request in console and opening any of the tabs (data / headers / etc).


Actual results:

Nothing was present in tabs


Expected results:

Might be a Thunderbird issue, I don't have that installed to check on. I tried to search for existing bug on both Tb & Seamonkey, but am not used to the search options here & may have missed it.


Actual results:

When on, ""Display Attachments Inline"" shows the text attachment as desired.
When off, no attachments are listed to open and view.

(Attached sample file has only an attachment, which shows normally with ""Display inline"" on. When ""Display inline"" is off, the message appears completely empty.)


Expected results:

I expect that either the attachment would be ignored in both toggles [undesired, but if the message is malformed might make sense]

"Composer: leaving the ""Source"" tab overwrites the X11 primary selection",1786198,NEW,--,,2022-08-21 11:49:11+00:00,2022-08-21 11:49:11+00:00,"In SeaMonkey Composer on X11, switching from the ""Source"" tab to another tab will replace the primary selection with the content of the editable document source code (everything but the doctype line?).

To reproduce:
1) Open Composer, switch to the ""Source"" tab
2) Set the primary selection (for example, if xclip is installed, run ""echo test | xclip -i"" in a terminal emulator).
At this point, if you paste the primary selection (can be tested with ""xclip -o"", for example), it will show ""test"".
3) Switch to another tab in Composer
4) Check/paste the selection content (possibly with ""xclip -o"" again), it now pastes the document source from Composer."

`SetEditMode` should not use `editor.transactionManager.maxTransactionCount` to disable undo temporarily and clear undo stack,1792764,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2022-09-29 00:30:48+00:00,2023-01-02 22:05:42+00:00,"https://searchfox.org/comm-central/rev/77f980a5aeac0a1aef7285bcfea6e64241fc0263/suite/editor/base/content/editor.js#1851-1856,1890-1893

These blocks are performed before and after updating the WYSIWYG editor for newer source code. However, I don't understand it wants to keep undoable only the updating.

I'll remove `nsIEditor.transactionManager` in bug 1768315, therefore, SeaMonkey needs to replace them with a call of `editor.enableUndo(false)` and `editor.enableUndo(true)`. Then, the calls of the XHTML path between them are not necessary."

security.warn_leaving_secure not enforced for redirects,1794013,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2022-10-06 18:07:07+00:00,2022-10-06 18:07:25+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:100.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/100.0

Steps to reproduce:

Set security.warn_leaving_secure = true
Test 1:
Go to: https://www.enet.umn.edu/
then: http://paulfm.com

Test 2:
Go to: https://www.enet.umn.edu/
Go to: https://www.aem.umn.edu/
(or even Go to: http://www.aem.umn.edu/ )


Note - this is specifically: Seamonkey 2.53.13
(I suspect the now current 2.53.14 release has the same bug - just haven't tested it yet).


Actual results:

Test 1: You are warned that the destination page is insecure.
Test 2: NO WARNING, even though ""https://www.aem.umn.edu/"" first redirects to ""http://www.aem.umn.edu/"" before it goes to: ""https://cse.umn.edu/aem""
(in the obvious case of the user going directly to ""http://www.aem.umn.edu/ "" it still does not warn you as the final page is https).



Expected results:

Test2: The user should be stopped at ""http://www.aem.umn.edu/"" with a warning about leaving a secure page.

Actually, in all cases it would be better if the warning prevented the page from loading/downloading until you clicked what to do in the warning field (show site [or continue], block site, go back).

Even better (even if you don't have security.warn_leaving_secure = true), a server redirect from https to http should always stop and ask you to continue or not (maybe a new setting that defaults to that but can be turned off).  Note, a bad certificate should be treated that same a http in the case of redirection.
(a redirection through a non-secure page opens a user in a coffee shop up to numerous attracts by someone else in that coffee shop or the person running the wireless network).

I note that Firefox (incorrectly in my opinion) no longer supports security.warn_leaving_secure (people don't check the ""icon"" after they click a link on a secure page).  Setting that to default to true may actually start waking up (at least seamonkey) users to the insecure sites that are still on the internet (and maybe get firefox users to demand it be added back in)."

Steps to reproduce:

(running latest Windows 10 OS)
1. Open Seamonkey (Version 2.53.14)
2. Click on Help (Top Menu)
3. Click on About Seamonkey
4. Move cursor over the bottom taskbar and over the Seamonkey (you should see two small Seamonkey windows showing just above the taskbar)
5. Move cursor over the About Seamonkey window showing above taskbar (small window, not the Seakonkey window on the main screen)
6. While on that small About Seamonkey window, move cursor over the X in the top right corner and click the X to close the window


Actual results:

The window closes but it re-opens a new window. Click the X again and it will close and re-open again. It won't close no matter how many times you click the X, it just keeps re-opening.

"dump_sys crashes on crosscompile with ""terminating with uncaught exception of type std::out_of_range vector""",1795820,NEW,--,,2022-10-18 05:47:41+00:00,2022-10-19 01:01:42+00:00,"Currently MacOSX crosscompile buildsymbols seems to be missing the generation of the XUL symbols.

Even after a 'successful' generation of symbols, the XUL symbol dSYM tarball and .sym file were missing in the <objdir>/dist/crashreporter-symbols.

After much trial and error, it seems as if the symbolstore.py seems to be 'eating' up the
terminating error. 

Particularly: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/crashreporter/tools/symbolstore.py#l580

 proc = subprocess.Popen(
                cmd,
                universal_newlines=True,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            )

As the <objdir>/dist/host/bin/dump_sys was built using the $CROSSCOMPILE$/macos/clang/lib path,  I tried the following manual run:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/crosscompile/macos/clang/lib /data/tmp/build/build/macosx/llvm-dsymutil --arch=x86_64 /data/tmp/obj-mac/toolkit/library/XUL

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/crosscompile/macos/clang/lib /data/tmp/obj-mac/dist/host/bin/dump_syms  -g /data/tmp/obj-mac/toolkit/library/XUL.dSYM  /data/tmp/obj-mac/toolkit/library/XUL
terminating with uncaught exception of type std::out_of_range: vector
Aborted

At this point, I'm somewhat stumped as to what the issue is.  Since dump_syms worked on the other files [certutil et. al],  I'm guessing that something is funky with the 
creating of objdir/toolkit/library/XUL.

Rename devtools/shim to devtools/startup - SeaMonkey parts,1812367,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2023-01-25 16:57:38+00:00,2023-04-16 12:45:59+00:00,"Some changes were missed for SeaMonkey in the cc patches attached to bug 1444926

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1444926 +++

The name devtools/shim was chosen for DevTools gofaster, but since the addon plans are on hold, we could rename this folder to make it less confusing.

Since the folder contains all the startup code that can run before devtools are started or initialized, I think devtools/startup would be a good fit.

We should also cleanup all references to the devtools addon, and remove them."

Clicking a link in an email fails to open browser if browser has not been opened during the session,1816194,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2023-02-10 21:43:44+00:00,2024-02-27 17:44:01+00:00,"Steps to reproduce:

On Windows, with SeaMonkey not running, launch SeaMonkey Mail, then click on any link to any site in any email.

This issue began with 2.53.15; 2.53.14 and previous versions did not have this issue.

The issue does not occur if the SeaMonkey browser has been used since the current instance of seamonkey.exe was launched (either by the user explicitly launching the browser or by successfully launching it from an email); it only happens if the browser is being launched for the first time in this session by clicking a link in an email.


Actual results:

seamonkey.exe's CPU usage rises (to approximately the equivalent of one full core) for several seconds, Windows shows SeaMonkey as not responding, and then things go back to normal - but no browser window opens.  After this one episode, clicking links will work properly for as long as the instance of seamonkey.exe is running.


Expected results:

The browser window should open promptly, and without excessive CPU consumption or being shown as ""not responding""."

Spellcheck no longer works with --enable-system-hunspell,1820413,RESOLVED,--,WONTFIX,2023-03-05 20:22:40+00:00,2023-07-10 20:35:09+00:00,"I package SeaMonkey for openSUSE and we use `ac_add_options --enable-system-hunspell` in the `.mozconfig` file. This has worked for us up to and including SeaMonkey 2.53.15.  Starting with SeaMonkey 2.53.16b1, building SeaMonkey this way results in a non-functional spellchecker.  SeaMonkey still finds all the system dictionaries, and allows the user to select among them, but no matter which dictionary is selected, all words to be spellchecked are shown with a red wavy underline.  Meanwhile, the following sorts of error messages are printed to the system console:

```
error: file:///usr/share/myspell/de_AT.aff: cannot open
error: file:///usr/share/myspell/de_AT.dic: cannot open
error: file:///usr/share/myspell/de_AT.aff: cannot open

```

Removing `ac_add_options --enable-system-hunspell` from `.mozconfig` restores the intended behaviour. (Interestingly, this is exactly the opposite of the workaround reported for Bug 1729113, which describes exactly the same symptoms.)

Some searching turns up Bug 1460600, which indicates that `--enable-system-hunspell` was removed from Firefox 62.  Has this change been backported to SeaMonkey 2.53.16b1?  If so, or if some similar change has been applied, perhaps this should be mentioned in the release notes so that users and packagers know not to use this option any more."

SeaMonkey version 2.53.16 calendar not properly displaying already-accepted event invitations on Windows 10,1826667,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2023-04-05 21:52:55+00:00,2023-07-10 20:34:08+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/111.0

Steps to reproduce:

Open Calendar in SeaMonkey 2.53.16 on Windows 10.
Step 1:  Hover mouse over existing events and the details seem to show correctly for all of them.
Step 2:  Double-click an event that was originally created by double-clicking in the calendar.  The ""Edit Event:"" form shows correctly for all these events.
Step 3:  Double-click an event that was originally created by accepting an invitation.  Rather than the small ""Edit Event"" form, a larger form is shown instead with:  1) no text in the header bar; 2) top-level menues for ""Save and Close"", ""Accept"", ""Tentative"", and ""Decline""; 3) the body of the form has the word ""General"" in bold followed by a horizontal line, and ""Title:"" one line below that, and ""Calendar:"" one line below ""Title""; much white space; and buttons for ""OK"" and ""Cancel"" in the lower right .  Neither button is functional.  This appears to be the form to accept an invitation, but this even has already been accepted (which is why it's in the calendar).  Click the ""X"" in the upper right to close the form and it does close, but now the mouse when hovered over the calendar is an hourglass; even so, it seems to be completely functional despite being the hourglass icon.
Step 4:  Close the calendar and open it again and everything seems back to normal, but you will start back at Step 1 each time.

Note A:  Because the details show on hover, I do not think the file local.sqlite is being corrupted.  I did try using the backup of this file I made before updating SeaMonkey to 2.23.16, and I got the same results.
Note B:  The pop-up Reminder form mostly works for events originally created by accepting an invitation, including the ""Snooze for"" feature.  But when I click on the ""Details"" link on the Reminder form for an affected event, I get the same issues as described above when trying to open it directly from the calendar interface.  For events created by double-clicking on the calendar, the pop-up Reminder works correctly in its entirety.

My conclusion:  Something is not being processed correctly for calendar events that were originally created by accepting an event invitation.


Actual results:

See ""Step 3"" description above.


Expected results:

The ""Edit Event"" form should show."

moz-do-not-send default in Composer blocks images in html pages,1833236,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2023-05-15 20:06:01+00:00,2023-05-25 02:18:53+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Steps to reproduce:

When adding images to html pages I created a table and inserted an image in each cell.  The dimension of each image is customized.   I omit alt text.  I save the .html file and upload to the server with Filezilla.  Removing the moz-do-not-send entry with Advanced Edit doesn't work--that entry returns after I remove it and save. I've deleted images and inserted them again, erased the html and jpg files from the web site and uploaded them again, checked that the URL is relative to page location in Composer and that the images are located in the desired directories.
The problem page is http://flanaganphoto.com/gallery-Trains.html


Actual results:

In Composer some images, newly added, have moz-do-not-send set to True by default in the Advanced Edit. The visible result is that the image doesn't appear in the page when editing in Composer nor does the image appear in the page read from the website. 


Expected results:

Images inserted into html pages should be visible in Composer and on pages read from the web site.  Expected behavior is based on using Composer to maintain multiple domains for over 20 years.

"""control reaches end of non-void function"" error when building cubeb",1843010,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2023-07-12 08:46:36+00:00,2023-08-26 22:30:22+00:00,"SeaMonkey 2.53.17b1 fails to build with GCC on openSUSE Tumbleweed, emitting an error when compiling cubeb:

```

```

The problem seems to be that GCC (possibly unlike Clang) is more fussy, or less intelligent, about reaching the end of a non-void function without a `return` statement, as occurs in `cubeb_utils.cpp`: 

```
size_t cubeb_sample_size(cubeb_sample_format format)
{
  switch (format) {
    case CUBEB_SAMPLE_S16LE:
    case CUBEB_SAMPLE_S16BE:
      return sizeof(int16_t);
    case CUBEB_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE:
    case CUBEB_SAMPLE_FLOAT32BE:
      return sizeof(float);
    default:
      // should never happen as all cases are handled above.
      assert(false);
  }
}
```

The build config for cubeb seems to treat such return-type warnings as errors. The problem can be worked around by adding `  __builtin_unreachable();` after the `switch` statement; this is a non-standard compiler optimization hint that is recognized by GCC (and also Clang, I believe).  An alternative solution would be to update the build config for cubeb with something like `Wno-error=return-type`; I think some other third-party modules bundled with SeaMonkey do something similar.

The problem has already been reported upstream: https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb/issues/736"

"2.53.17b1 with RequestPolicy extension loads only a few tabs, not even the current one for all windows - further browsing impossible",1846616,RESOLVED,--,WONTFIX,2023-08-01 21:15:36+00:00,2023-08-26 22:47:39+00:00,"Regression in 2.53.17b1 (DE, Win64), previous versions working.
I have 8 windows open with between 5 and 50 tabs each. Normally, SeaMonkey loads the content of all of them during Suite startup (disk cache is disabled, SM uses less than 1 of my 32 GB RAM, 1 GBit internet connection, Windows 10 with Defender).
With 2.53.17b1, only very few of those tabs are loaded during Suite startup, often not even the current one of each window (FireFox only loads the current tabs of all windows during startup). The  SeaMonkey GUI is still working, but it is not possible to manually load any of the missing contents or a new tab with Bugzilla (so I'm typing this with 2.53.16 after going back and forth three times).
Mail is also affected, I can see the list of messages in several accounts, but selecting a message doesn't display it in the lower right of the mail window.

I'm using the following extensions:
ChatZilla 0.16 (or 0.17 with the beta version)

Two mouse behaviors broke in 2.53.17:  1) scroll with mouse wheel press; 2) Mouse Gestures Suite add-on.,1848823,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2023-08-15 17:00:45+00:00,2023-08-15 17:00:45+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.17

Steps to reproduce:

1)  Updated to SeaMonkey version 2.53.17 on Windows 10.

2a)  Pressed and held scroll wheel on mouse to scroll web pages (browser) & emails (mail/newsgroups).

2b)  Depressed/held right mouse button and dragged the mouse to use gestures of Mouse Gestures Suite 2.5.1.

Both these behaviors do work in the previous version (2.53.16).  I list them together here rather than in two separate bug reports because they are both mouse-related and the behavior of SM is the same for both.  Also, I do realize that the Mouse Gestures Suite will eventually stop working, and maybe now is that time, and that MGS is not a Mozilla product.  But having both these mouse behaviors change in the same way at the same time seemed suspicious to me so I thought I'd report them together as perhaps they have a common cause.


Actual results:

2a)  Pressing the mouse wheel changes focus to a different control (if the mouse pointer is not over the control currently with focus), and that's all.  This happens at mousedown, and applies to giving focus to text boxes, buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, and likely other controls.  Pressing and holding does nothing more.  A full down/up mouseclick is not necessary to make this behavior happen.

When pressing the mouse wheel within a text box that already has focus, nothing happens -- i.e., the cursor is not moved.  Similarly, buttons and boxes are not clicked.  So it appears a full mouseclick event is not triggered.

After pressing the mouse wheel down and a different control is given focus, and while still holding the wheel down, it is possible to select and edit text within a text box (such as I'm filling out right now) using the keyboard.

2b)  As with the mouse wheel in 2a, pressing the right mouse button to initiate a gesture instead will change focus -- all the same behaviors described for the mouse wheel in 2a appear to apply here as well.  All Mouse Gestures Suite 2.5.1 functions are disabled, I presume because they are being preempted by this other mouse behavior.


Expected results:

2a)  Pressing and holding the mouse wheel should change the pointer icon, and allow scrolling.  Note that scrolling using the mouse wheel (without pressing it) does still work -- it is only press-and-hold that does not work.

2b)  Pressing/holding the right mouse button and dragging should allow for gestures to function."

Incorrect browser version in user agent when resistFingerprinting is enabled,1862395,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2023-11-01 10:21:08+00:00,2025-01-26 17:22:18+00:00,"Steps to reproduce:

- Enable privacy.resistFingerprinting in about:config
- View user agent in about: or a website


Actual results:

User agent is ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:-1.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/-1.0""
Version is incorrectly -1.0. Seamonkey uses a now-incorrect formula to predict the latest ESR release and is possibly getting the incorrect current version number (nsRFPService::GetSpoofedUserAgent in toolkit/components/resistfingerprinting/nsRFPService.cpp).


Expected results:

Firefox version number should be something more sensible. In firefox upstream the user agent version is pretty much hardcoded through the build system."

Themes not updated when installing 2.53.18b1,1865454,NEW,--,,2023-11-18 04:21:25+00:00,2023-12-03 11:25:34+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 SeaMonkey/2.53.17.1

Steps to reproduce:

Installe SeaMonkey 2.53.18b1


Actual results:

When opening the Addons Manager the SeaMonkey Default Theme and the SeaMonkey Modern Theme versions are not updated and is marked as incompatible, and If I try to switch between themes, then it is not possible.

It only happens with my work profile, not with virgin profiles that only has one extra them installed.


Expected results:

The SeaMonkey Default Theme and the SeaMonkey Modern Theme versions should show up as version 2.53.18 and I should be able to switch between themes as usual.

If I restore SeaMonkey 2.53.17.1 and restore my profile, everything works again.

I expect the problem lies in my extensions.json so I attach both my extensions.json file from v. 2.53.17.1 from before updating and extensions.json from after installing v. 2.53.18b1"

Freeze on Linux (out of memory) if deleting many history entries,1868920,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2023-12-08 01:00:07+00:00,2023-12-08 01:00:07+00:00,"Steps to reproduce:

8 GB, 15 GB swap, select maybe well over 100,000 history entries, select delete. This was observed on 2.53.18 beta 1. Debian buster (oldoldstable).


Actual results:

I watch (""System Monitor"") because Seamonkey annoyingly leaks (on this 32GB laptop, to 4-5GB) and then as the used memory is reduced, one thread goes to 100% and all Seamonkey activity is blocked while I suppose Garbage Collection is done.
During the delete historyoverkill, Seamonkey is blocked, (virtual) memory very slowly goes to 98-99%, then swap is very slowly to 100%, then there is no thread at 100% - instead Seamonkey is quiescent. I did not see that any history entries were deleted after I killed and restarted.


Expected results:

If only 100 or 1,000 (or maybe more, a couple of bunches), Seamonkey will slowly go through the selected entries, occasionally refresh the History window (although it is not clear it changed the window's content) and eventually refreshes the window, showing the top entry as selected, and reflects that the selected entries have been deleted."

Use Seamonkey in Windows 11 23H2

Visit http://getemoji.com/


Actual results:

Emoji from two or maybe even three fonts are displayed. See attached screenshot.


Expected results:

Firefox bundles EmojiOne on certain platforms for a reason: Because they have no or incomplete emoji support. Therefore on platforms where Firefox ships EmojiOne, that font should take precedence over competing, incomplete fonts.

Bonus points for an additional option in the font configurator to pick the preferred emoji font. Considering that Twitter, Google, etc. also make free emoji sets, users may wanna pick their favorite set."

Upon opening SeaMonkey Mail & Newsgroups, many folders are missing from the directory in my primary IMAP mail account. I opened File:Subscribe... and the missing folders were listed. I clicked the checkbox next to each missing folder. In some cases, the checkmark did not appear. In other cases, the check mark appeared after a wait of up to 30 seconds. I clicked the Subscribe button, and closed the Subscribe... dialog. 

Please note that clicking the Refresh button at any time reverts the checked folders to the unchecked state, even after clicking the Subscribe button.


Actual results:

The subscribed folders did not appear in the mail folder directory after clicking the Subscribe button. Multiple repetitions of the same process sometimes succeeded in making one or two of the missing folder appear, but upon closing the Mail & Newsgroups app, the folders had disappeared. In no case was it possible to get the missing folders to appear in the mail folders directory. After selecting all folders and clicking the Subscribe button, clicking the Refresh button should populate the mail folders directory with all folders checked and subscribed.


Expected results:

All mail folders in the IMAP account should appear in the mail folders directory after subscribing to them in the Subscribe... dialog.

I consider this a serious bug, as it prevents the user from accessing messages in the missing folders in the IMAP account. One of the missing folders is the Unsent Messages folder. When prompted ""Do you want to send unsent messages?"" there is no way to review the unsent messages to determine whether or not to send them.

www.mouser.com and many other internetsites - Extremely high memory and processor usage. After this the computer is extremely slowing down till it freezes. Problem has existed since it was Netscape.,1870948,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2023-12-19 23:16:50+00:00,2025-01-08 20:23:35+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

Steps to reproduce:

https://nl.mouser.com/

Open multiple Mouser screens/tabs (5 to 40 or more) or are search for 5 to 40 or more products in Mouser in the same or new screens/tabs.

Computer:
HP xw8600
Memory: 32GB
Processor: 2 Intel Xeon CPU E5430 2.67 GHz

The computer works fine and very fast with all programs and all normal internetsites.


Actual results:

If you have multiple Mouser screens/tabs (5 to 40 or more) open or are searching for 5 to 40 or more products in Mouser, there is an extremely high memory and processor usage. The memory usage will become about 3GB (GigaByte). The processor usage will become about 20 to 40% or after more screens/tabs almost 100%. After this the computer is extremely slowing down till it freezes. If you closes all Mouser screens/tabs the memory usage will not lower on its own. The processor usage will become about 5 to 15%. After this the computer freezes about a fraction to an half second every 5 to 10 seconds. It is needed to restart SeaMonkey to clean the memory and lower the processor usage. After restarting SeaMonkey everything is normal.

The computer is still very fast with all programs and all normal internetsites. There is many free memory and harddisk space.

I have tried this at many computers with processors from Intel 80486 to Xeon E5430, almost all Windows from 95 to 10. and many Linux versions, almost every day, thousands of times at Mouser and other internet sites in almost 30 years. 

This problem has existed since it was Netscape. Many internetsites have this problem.


Expected results:

No high memory and processor usage.

Cancel button in SeaMonkey bookmarking star ui not working,1872623,ASSIGNED,--,,2024-01-01 21:47:10+00:00,2025-01-26 01:30:34+00:00,"When you edit a bookmark via our bookmarking star dialog in the urlbar Cancel does nothing in 2.53 up to 19b1pre when you edit fields. This is treated like ""Done"". The dialog in 2.57 with the sync bookmarking api removed undos the last transaction which, unless you entered values, is usually completely unrelated to this. I think the button should be removed. Not in Firefox.

There might be a way to fix this with deleting the undo transactions when the dialog opens but this might have side effects if you have the library open in a seperate window. A proper fix would probably needed named transactions in toolkit. The current api does not have this and just use an undo stack of the last commands from all over the place(s). Given that no one reported any problem here for 2.53.x, remove and done work fine I would go the easy way."

Calendar Color Chooser Unresponsive After Calendar Creation,1892999,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2024-04-23 17:09:56+00:00,2024-04-23 17:09:56+00:00,"Steps to reproduce:

I have CalDav calendars on a remote system (internal to my network).  When I *create* the calendar in Seamonkey, I can set the color via the color chooser dialog box just fine.  However, if the calendar is _already_ created and I select ""Properties"" of an existing calendar and click the color button, the Color Chooser Dialog shows, but is completely unresponsive.


Actual results:

The Color Chooser Dialog showed, but is completely unresponsive...I can't even click 'X' to close the color chooser window.  I can only go back to the properties dialog and click ""Cancel"" which closes the Color Chooser dialog and the Properties dialog. Clicking ""OK"" on the Properties dialog doesn't work to close out properties or the color chooser...it must be ""Cancel"".


Expected results:

The color chooser should have allowed us to select a color and set the calendar color similar to when creating the calendar.

> **Steps to Reproduce**:
> While the ""year"" view uses the full width of the browser window, any other view (""Day"", ""Week"", etc.) only uses a very small portion of the available width. 
> 
> It appears that the CSS setting of ""position"" of class ""K2fuAf"" is to blame. At the loaded setting ""absolute"", the rendering is wrong (horizontally compressed). If that ""position"" property is removed or changed to ""relative"" then the rendering is correct. 
> 
> Both Firefox and Chrome display the Google Calendar pages correctly, so I don't think the CSS is to blame. 
> 
> The problem appears to be a relatively new one since it has not been long ago when I still could use Google Calendar with Seamonkey.

Unable to use Oauth2 with outlook.com authentication,1907087,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2024-07-10 13:53:43+00:00,2024-07-20 06:53:03+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Create a new profile. Select the mail/news window. Add an email account using an outlook email address. Servers are: imap: outlook.office365.com smtp: smtp-mail.outlook.com. (I don't think the server names are significant to microsoft as they point to the same address whether outlook.com or office365.com, but maybe they are significant to seamonkey.) Select the authentication method of oauth2 with SSL/TLS. A window opens inviting login to microsoft. An error message occurs:

""You can't sign in here with a personal account. Use your work or school account instead.""



Actual results:

A window opens inviting login to microsoft. An error message occurs:

""You can't sign in here with a personal account. Use your work or school account instead.""



Expected results:

A log in process and then normal access to email.

Microsoft is withdrawing support for password access (probably including app passwords) on 16th September 2024.

Observation: Thunderbird supports oauth2 with outlook, as does Evolution.

Download fails when memory full,1909055,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2024-07-20 16:55:49+00:00,2024-07-20 16:55:49+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0

Steps to reproduce:

I noticed on 2.53.18.2 that downloads fail silently as memory approaches 100% use. 2.53.19b1 has a similar problem. With 30-50 windows, downloading from each, memory use steadily increases. With 2.53.19b1, memory use stops at 80% so the same effect happens a little quicker. One may restart Seamonkey to restart downloading. The problem occurs with images and pdf files, and I imagine other files as well.


Actual results:

Download Manager reports download complete, blank for the amount downloaded, and the file is corrupted. Right-click to the link, shift to Firefox, the file is downloaded successfully, showing it is a Seamonkey problem. 


Expected results:

Perhaps browsing activity is saved in memory and that could be conserved. The exception could be handled more gracefully, either notifying the user of the failure or saving the data nevertheless, which Firefox is managing to do in the same low memory situation."

When I want to size the messages/message details view with the pane splitter it doesn't work. It makes the splitter larger instead (see screenshot).

I have this add-on installed, which changes the headers...

"""Save Page As"" -> ""Web page, complete"" fails to save the main HTML file",1911223,NEW,--,,2024-08-02 01:48:13+00:00,2024-12-03 14:57:56+00:00,"For certain web pages, attempting to save the complete web page via ""Save Page As"" -> ""Web page, complete"" saves an incomplete version of the page.

An example of a web page with this problem is <https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/courses/CPSC436N-23/index.html>.  Saving this as ""Web page, complete"" results in only a ""CPSC 436N  Natural Language Processing_files"" directory containing the files jquery.js, ubc-clf-full.css, ubc-clf.js, and unit.html.  I'm not sure whether any files are missing in this directory, but definitely missing is the file ""CPSC 436N  Natural Language Processing.html"" in its parent directory.

Firefox 128.0 has no problem saving the same page, though it names the file and directory somewhat differently, and the contents of the directory are different.  (I'm not sure if this is part of the bug or if it's due to different content being served as a result of server-side user-agent sniffing.)"

Port or come up with an alternative to fallout from removing global.dtd from toolkit.,1916467,NEW,--,,2024-09-03 14:50:42+00:00,2024-09-03 14:50:42+00:00,"In one of the bugs involving prep for fluent translation `global.dtd` was removed. The only entity defined was the value for an attribute for text direction on an element. Mozilla and Thunderbird switch any remaining usage in the xhtml to either hardcoding ltr or auto in the few places this remains used.

In a draft effort to research SeaMonkey reconstruction on central I followed this on an adhoc basis but this may not be the best course for SeaMonkey even if it ever returns to building on central.

The DTD system is still functional on central so an alternative could be to bring global.dtd to suite's communicator chrome package and just update the URLs until such time DTDs are no longer accepted or SeaMonkey is converted to Fluent.

The dtd-to-comm strategy would also be usable on SM253 as well if that was the preferred direction.. so to speak."

SeaMonkey doesn't launch on macOS 15.1 Sequoia,1924612,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2024-10-15 00:57:36+00:00,2024-12-18 14:40:16+00:00,"On macOS 15.1 Sequoia Beta 6 (24B5070a), clicking on SeaMonkey in the Dock displays a dialog window with the Finder icon, an OK button and the following text:

```
The application “Dock” does not have permission to open “(null)”.
```

Similarly, double-clicking the SeaMonkey app bundle in Finder displays two subsequent dialog windows with the Finder icon, an OK button and the following text:

```
The application “Finder” does not have permission to open “(null)”.

This problem was not present with the previous macOS beta, that is macOS 15.1 Sequoia Beta 5 (24B5055e).
I'm pretty sure it started after updating to Beta 6 (24B5070a), without changing the installed SeaMonkey version.

I verified this problem with SeaMonkey 2.53.19 and SeaMonkey nightly 2.53.20b1pre from [nightly/2024/10/2024-10-13-21-00-03-comm-253](https://archive.seamonkey-project.org/nightly/2024/10/2024-10-13-21-00-03-comm-253/index.html).

SeaMonkey freezes when Windows defender anti virus is scanning the mailbox files and does not stop scanning the files,1925322,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2024-10-17 17:02:19+00:00,2025-02-02 13:09:17+00:00,"Steps to reproduce:

Normal use of SeaMonkey.

Buildnaam: 20240827170848


Actual results:

SeaMonkey freezes when Windows defender anti virus is scanning the mailbox files and does not stop scanning the files. Sometimes it starts and then SeaMonkey freezes. It is needed to turn of Windows security realtime security for several times. After this it stops and SeaMonkey works again.

I have more than 30000 (about 35000) e-mails in 4 e-mailboxes. If I turn on the automatically checking for e-mail, SeaMonkey will freeze. This is with POP3 and IMAP. If I turn this off with IMAP, then sometimes Windows Defender starts freezing SeaMonkey. I used POP3 for more than 30 years with Netscape/SeaMonkey and I had never problems. Since 2 weeks there are problems and somtimes SeaMonkey creates multiples incoming e-mails of the same e-mails. KPN webmail receives only 1 e-mail. I called the KPN helpdesk and there are no problems with the KPN servers.

I have uninstalled SeaMonkey, deleted all SeaMonkey directories / maps and reinstalled SeaMonkey.

Now I use IMAP for 2 weeks, because POP3 will not work anymore with Windows Defender anti virus. IMAP does not has the problem with creating multiple e-mails.

This is since 2 weeks ago.


Expected results:

No freezing of SeaMonkey by Windows Defender anti virus."

Layout engine ignores sidebar width,1933743,UNCONFIRMED,--,,2024-11-27 15:27:09+00:00,2024-11-27 15:27:09+00:00,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Open the sidebar, and page content is no longer visible because it does not reflow. 


Actual results:

Even refreshing the web page results in a slice off the right side of the page being unviewable because the layout engine seems to use the full window width as the viewport width, rather than window width minus sidebar width.


Expected results:

The layout should take into account the viewport size, and ideally reflow as the sidebar is resized or toggled."

My steps:
- I open the html-page in Composer.
- I go to the menu Format - Title and Page properties.
- I change the title, click OK.

But Composer does not see the changes. The button with the floppy diskette icon is inactive and I cannot save the changes to the html page.
Then I manually press Space on the page so that Composer sees the changes. The button with the floppy diskette icon becomes active. I click on it and save the changes to the html-page.

the update to six 1.16 in bug #1857492 that was backported to 2.53.20b1 partially fixes it, but there's still a six.py from 1.15 under third_party/python/virtualenv/__virtualenv__/six-1.15.0-py2.py3-none-any/six.py

on top of that, the netwerk/dns/prepare_tlds.py bit from bug #1857516 is required to remove the usage of the now-removed `imp` module in py 3.12.

there are also various missing references to `distutils` module in mozbuild that suggest that the `sys.path` is wrong... so far i've worked it around by symlinking setuptools' `_distutils` copy at least in `mozbuild/` and `mozbuild/mozbuild`, which finally allows me to pass configure/have the python virtualenv created on 2.53.20b1.

and on top of that, i now have segfaults running the build-script-build rust command for at least the any_all_workaround crate, and probably others.

I even ran a virtual machine recompile dedicated to compiling Seamonkey, but the problem still arose.

Before compiling, I had turned off any anti-virus software (including Windows defender) and also installed the VS runtime.

After opening the compiled seamonkey, I found a serious problem. No matter what web page I opened (except the local page), it would prompt ""This Connection is Untrusted"" (SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER) and I could not enter the page
But when I used the seamonkey downloaded from ""https://www.seamonkey-project.org/"" or Firefox, the prompt ""This Connection is Untrusted"" would not appear 
How should I do it

Handling of MOZ_LANGPACK_CONTRIBUTORS in defines.inc files should be less custom,1951101,RESOLVED,--,FIXED,2025-02-28 14:14:11+00:00,2025-03-02 15:53:11+00:00,"By now, Seamonkey is the only place where we still have this oddity in [suite/locale/en-US/defines.inc](https://gitlab.com/seamonkey-project/seamonkey-2.53-comm/-/blob/master/suite/locales/en-US/defines.inc) and [suite/extensions/irc/locale/en-US/defines.inc](https://gitlab.com/seamonkey-project/seamonkey-2.53-comm/-/blob/master/suite/extensions/irc/locales/en-US/defines.inc):
```
# If non-English locales wish to credit multiple contributors, uncomment this
# variable definition and use the format specified.
# #define MOZ_LANGPACK_CONTRIBUTORS <em:contributor>Joe Solon</em:contributor> <em:contributor>Suzy Solon</em:contributor>
```

This is requiring additional care in Pontoon, as it's the only place where we have a commented source message being used as an actual message.

Given how these files are handled in [langpack_manifest.py](https://gitlab.com/seamonkey-project/seamonkey-2.53-mozilla/-/blob/master/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/action/langpack_manifest.py#L363) and [preprocessor.py](https://gitlab.com/seamonkey-project/seamonkey-2.53-mozilla/-/blob/2_53_20_final/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/preprocessor.py#L607), an empty value here would be handled exactly the same as a commented-out value

Therefore, could the contents of the en-US source be updated to something like the following? Doing so would not invalidate any translations, but it would allow us to drop the customization needed in Pontoon for this one message.

```
# A space-separated list of contributors, each wrapped in an <em:contributor> element. Can be left empty.
# Example: <em:contributor>Joe Solon</em:contributor> <em:contributor>Suzy Solon</em:contributor>
#define MOZ_LANGPACK_CONTRIBUTORS
