就在刚刚，我似乎发现了一个此编辑器的C语言调试功能的bug（并非单纯的代码错误）
（事实上我并不确定这到底算不算是个调试bug）

这个bug的触发条件有些苛刻，具体如下：

首先，我创建了一个结构体类型test


```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct _test
{
    int a;
    float b;
} test;
```


然后，在main函数中，我创建了一个文件指针来读取我的test2.txt文件

`    FILE *fp = fopen(""test2.txt"", ""r"");`

test2.txt的内容如下：

`100 1.2 100 3.4`

然后，我malloc了一个大小为sizeof(test)的test类型的指针p

`    test *p = (test *)malloc(sizeof(test));`

### Description

cuando actualize el editor a la ultima versión, los archivos con formato .blade.php tiene un error el la visualizacion de los colores, estueb revisando si era un extencion pero no fue el caso, entonses lo desistale y instale la version anterior y sirvio correctamente como se suponia que debia ser, y siempre con las mismas extenciones lo cual me da a entender que no es un problema por falta del mismo.

Saludos
