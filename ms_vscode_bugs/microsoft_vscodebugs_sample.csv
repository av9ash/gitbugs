It appears that all the other features still work as normal. This action is reversible.When the bug is active  VSCode will either show an error message  or not render any text. This prevents the user from editing the `settings.json` file to fix it.(Note that it can be fixed by either fixing  moving  or deleting the `settings.json` file.)> [!caution]> This bug causes the text editor to __stop functioning__.Steps to Reproduce:1. Enable bracket matching / colourising.2. Set the `editor.language.brackets` or the `editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs` to an invalid value.For example:```jsonc{    ""editor.language.brackets"": [[""<""  ["">""]]]}```or```jsonc{    ""editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs"": [        [""{""  ""}""]         [""[""  ""]""]         // The following is faulty        [[""${""]  ""}""]    ]}```To fix the file  you need to revert it back to a previous working state (e.g. using the Timeline  or an external Text Editor).",bug:important:editor-core,Potentially FATAL: Invalid `editor.language.brackets` or `editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs`
